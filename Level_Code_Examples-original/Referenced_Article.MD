Building
 AI agents isn't about chasing hype or stacking features — it's about 
getting the fundamentals right. Each level, from basic tool use to fully
 asynchronous agentic systems, adds power *only* when the underlying architecture is sound.

Most
 failures don't come from missing the latest framework. They come from 
ignoring the basics: clear boundaries, solid reasoning, effective 
memory, and knowing when to let humans take the wheel.

If
 you start simple, build up with purpose, don't overcomplicate upfront 
and add complexity only when it solves a real problem, you won't just 
build something cool — you'll build something that works.

Alright, let's dive in.lty (With Full Code Implementation)

About two weeks before a big product deadline, my prototype agent broke in the worst way.

*It looked fine*.
 It fetched data, called tools, and even explained its steps. But under 
the hood, it was bluffing. No real state, no memory, no reasoning. Just 
looping prompts pretending to be smart.

I
 only noticed when an edge case completely threw it off. That’s when it 
hit me: I hadn’t built an agent. I’d built a fancy prompt chain.

Fixing
 it meant redesigning the whole thing — not just chaining calls, but 
managing state, decisions, and long-term flow. Once that clicked, 
everything got simpler. The code, the logic, the results.

That’s what this guide is about: breaking agent design into five practical levels of difficulty — each with working code.

Whether
 you’re just starting out or trying to scale real-world tasks, this will
 help you avoid the traps I fell into and build agents that actually 
work.

The levels are:

- **Level 1: Agent with Tools and Instructions**
- **Level 2: Agent with Knowledge and Memory**
- **Level 3: Agent with Long-Term Memory and Reasoning**
- **Level 4: Multi-Agent Teams**
- **Level 5: Agentic Systems**

Alright, let’s dive in.

# **Level 1: Agent with Tools and Instructions**

This is the basic setup — an LLM that follows instructions and calls tools in a loop. When people say, “*agents are just LLMs plus tool use*,” they’re talking about this level (and revealing how far they’ve explored).

Instructions
 tell the agent what to do. Tools let it take action — fetching data, 
calling APIs, or triggering workflows. It’s simple, but already powerful
 enough to automate some tasks.

```
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agno_assist = Agent(
  name="Agno AGI",
  model=0penAIChat(id="gpt-4.1"),
  description=dedent("""\
  You are "Agno AGI, an autonomous AI Agent that can build agents using the Agno)
  framework. Your goal is to help developers understand and use Agno by providing
  explanations, working code examples, and optional visual and audio explanations
  of key concepts."""),
  instructions="Search the web for information about Agno.",
  tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
  add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
  markdown=True,
)
  agno_assist.print_response("What is Agno?", stream=True)
```

# Level 2: Agent with Knowledge and Memory

Most
 tasks require information the model doesn’t have. You can’t stuff 
everything into context, so the agent needs a way to fetch knowledge at 
runtime — this is where agentic RAG or dynamic few-shot prompting comes 
in.

Search
 should be hybrid (full-text + semantic), and reranking is a must. 
Together, hybrid search + reranking is the best plug-and-play setup for 
agentic retrieval.

Storage
 gives the agent memory. LLMs are stateless by default; storing past 
actions, messages, and observations makes the agent stateful — able to 
reference what’s happened so far and make better decisions.

# Level 3: Agent with Long-Term Memory and Reasoning

Memory
 lets agents recall details across sessions — like user preferences, 
past actions, or failed attempts — and adapt over time. This unlocks 
personalization and continuity. We’re just scratching the surface here, 
but what excites me most is self-learning: agents that refine their 
behavior based on past experiences.

Reasoning takes things a step further.

It
 helps the agent break down problems, make better decisions, and follow 
multi-step instructions more reliably. It’s not just about understanding
 — it’s about increasing the success rate of each step. Every serious 
agent builder needs to know when and how to apply it.

```

knowledge_base = ...

memory = Memory(
  # Use any model for creating nemories
  model=0penAIChat(id="gpt-4.1"),

  instructions=...,
  # Give the Agent the ability to reason
  tools=[PythonTools(), DuckDuckGoTools(),
  ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
  ...
  # Store memories in a sqlite database
  memory=memory,
  # Let the Agent manage its menories
  enable_agentic_memory=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  # You can comment this out after the first run and the agent will remember
  agno_assist.print_response("Always start your messages with 'hi ava'", stream=True)
  agno_assist.print_response("What is Agno?", stream=True)
```

# Level 4: Multi-Agent Teams

Agents
 are most effective when they’re focused — specialized in one domain 
with a tight toolset (ideally under 10). To tackle more complex or broad
 tasks, we combine them into teams. Each agent handles a piece of the 
problem, and together they cover more ground.

But
 there’s a catch: without strong reasoning, the team leader falls apart 
on anything nuanced. Based on everything I’ve seen so far, autonomous 
multi-agent systems still don’t work reliably. They succeed less than 
half the time — which isn’t good enough.

That said, some architectures make coordination easier. [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno),
 for example, supports three execution modes — coordinate, route, and 
collaborate — along with built-in memory and context management. You 
still need to design carefully, but these building blocks make serious 
multi-agent work more feasible.

# Level 5: Agentic Systems

> 📁 **Implementation**: *System-level architecture (varies by implementation)*  
> 📖 **Documentation**: [`level-5-agentic-systems/README.md`](./level-5-agentic-systems/README.md)

This
 is where agents go from being tools to infrastructure. Agentic Systems 
are full APIs — systems that take in a user request, kick off an async 
workflow, and stream results back as they become available.

Sounds clean in theory. In practice, it’s hard. Really hard.

You
 need to persist state when the request comes in, spin up a background 
job, track progress, and stream output as it’s generated. Websockets can
 help, but they’re tricky to scale and maintain. Most teams 
underestimate the backend complexity here.

This
 is what it takes to turn agents into real products. At this level, 
you’re not building a feature — you’re building a system.

# From Demo Fails to Real Wins: Key Lessons in Agent Design

Building
 AI agents isn’t about chasing hype or stacking features — it’s about 
getting the fundamentals right. Each level, from basic tool use to fully
 asynchronous agentic systems, adds power *only* when the underlying architecture is sound.

Most
 failures don’t come from missing the latest framework. They come from 
ignoring the basics: clear boundaries, solid reasoning, effective 
memory, and knowing when to let humans take the wheel.

If
 you start simple, build up with purpose, don’t overcomplicate upfront 
and add complexity only when it solves a real problem, you won’t just
