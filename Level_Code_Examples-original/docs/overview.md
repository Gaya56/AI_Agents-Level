## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Level 1** - Basic agent setup and tool integration
2. **Progress to Level 2** - Add knowledge bases and memory
3. **Advance to Level 3** - Implement reasoning and long-term memory
4. **Scale with Level 4** - Create multi-agent teams
5. **Deploy with Level 5** - Build full agentic systems

Each level builds upon the previous one, adding complexity and capabilities progressively.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Agno framework
- OpenAI API key
- Additional dependencies per level (see individual README files)
