### Level 4: Multi-Agent Teams
* Agents are most effective when they’re focused — specialized in one domain with a tight toolset (ideally under 10). To tackle more complex or broad tasks, we combine them into teams. Each agent handles a piece of the problem, and together they cover more ground.

* But there’s a catch: without strong reasoning, the team leader falls apart on anything nuanced. Based on everything I’ve seen so far, autonomous multi-agent systems still don’t work reliably. They succeed less than half the time — which isn’t good enough.

* That said, some architectures make coordination easier. Agno, for example, supports three execution modes — coordinate, route, and collaborate — along with built-in memory and context management. You still need to design carefully, but these building blocks make serious multi-agent work more feasible.
